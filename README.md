# Python Automation Portfolio

Welcome! I specialize in practical Python automations â€” scraping, Excel/report generation, and scheduling.  
This repository contains demo projects and client-ready automation tools built with:
- requests + BeautifulSoup (web scraping)
- pandas + openpyxl (Excel/report automation)
- Playwright (browser automation)
- smtplib (email delivery)
- GitHub Actions (scheduling)
